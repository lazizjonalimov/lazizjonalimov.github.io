                <h3>IT Systems & Data Specialist | Computer Science Graduate | Software Developer</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm an IT Systems & Data Specialist at SMT Trans, a recent Honors Computer Science graduate from Western Michigan University, 
                    with a minor in Data Analytics. I specialize in developing and maintaining fleet management systems, 
                    database management, and creating practical, user-friendly technology solutions that make a real impact in transportation and logistics operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With 2+ years of professional experience in IT systems, customer support, and software development, I've helped improve 
                    support efficiency by 11%, trained 300+ users, and mentored new team members. 
                    I'm skilled in Python, PHP, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and iOS development, with hands-on experience in 
                    web/mobile development, fleet management systems, and database management for trucking operations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently working as an IT Systems & Data Specialist, I manage IT infrastructure for fleet management systems and driver data, 
                    resolve software/hardware problems, and handle safety documentation for trucking operations. I was awarded a $60,000 merit scholarship 
                    and made the Dean's List multiple times. I'm always eager to learn and passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems 
                    in transportation and logistics.
