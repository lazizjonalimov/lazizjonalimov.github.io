                <h3>IT Systems & Data Specialist | Computer Science Graduate</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm an IT Systems & Data Specialist and recent Honors Computer Science graduate from Western Michigan University with a minor in Data Analytics. With over 2 years of experience across IT systems, software development, and customer support, I focus on building practical, scalable, and user-friendly technology solutions.

                <p>
                    In my current role at SMT Trans, I develop and maintain internal fleet management platforms, automate workflows, and manage IT infrastructure for drivers and logistics operations. I’ve built a custom Transportation Management System that reduced manual tracking by 60%, improved data accuracy by over 80%, and automated compliance processes to save significant time and prevent missed deadlines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previously, I supported IT operations at Western Michigan University and Streamline Healthcare Solutions, improving support efficiency by 11%, training 300+ users, mentoring new team members, and contributing to process improvements that enhanced response times and customer satisfaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m skilled in Python, PHP, JavaScript, React, Node.js, iOS development, full-stack development, and database management. I earned a competitive $60,000 merit-based scholarship and a $3,000 College of Engineering and Applied Sciences Scholarship for Fall 2023–Spring 2024, along with multiple Dean’s List honors. Motivated by continuous learning, I’m passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges—particularly in transportation, logistics, and automation.
